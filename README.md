# Fast-CT-Calibration-Imaging-Based-on-Novel-FBP
-----
## Summary
This is the source code of my team for Chinese Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modelling 2017. 

Main Contribution:
* We propose an algorithm for the calibration of CT system based on ReLU.
* We design a unique filter of Filter Back Projection for image reconstruction.
* We reconstruct the given image and gain excellent performance.
* We design a new template for CT calibration and evaluate the performance.
* We won National Second Prize in CUMCM2017.

## Usage

We use matlab to implement the algorithm. So you just need to run the source code without compiling.
